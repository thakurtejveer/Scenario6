# Scenario6


In this scenario, create three components, say component1, component2, and component3.
Component1 is a parent of both component2 and component3.
A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component1. The template of
component3 (sibling) should display the text.
Create the task in a scenario6 folder of your project. All files of the components should be inside the
scenario6 folder.
